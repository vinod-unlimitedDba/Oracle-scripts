JDBC Connections to PDBs
It has already been mentioned that you must connect to a PDB using a service. This means that by default many JDBC connect strings will be broken. Valid JDBC connect strings for Oracle use the following format.

# Syntax
jdbc:oracle:thin:@[HOST][:PORT]:SID
jdbc:oracle:thin:@[HOST][:PORT]/SERVICE

# Example
jdbc:oracle:thin:@ol6-121:1521:pdb1
jdbc:oracle:thin:@ol6-121:1521/pdb1
